  \begin{verse}
    \[C]Have you seen the \[G]old man, \[Am]in the closed-down \[Em]market
    \[Em]Picking up the \[C]papers, with his \[D7]worn-out \[G7]shoes?
    \[C]In his eyes you \[G]see no pride, \[Am]and held loosely \[Em]by his side
    \[F]Yesterday's \[C]papers, telling \[G7]yesterday's \[C]news
  \end{verse}

  \begin{chorus}
    \[C] So \[F]how can you \[Em]tell me, you're \[C]lo - ne - \[Am]ly
    \[D7] And say for \[D7]you that the sun don't \[G]shine? \[G7]
    \[C]Let me take you \[G]by the hand, and \[Am]lead you through the \[Em]streets of London
    \[F] I'll show you \[C]something, to \[G7]make you change your \[C]mind
  \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse}
      Have you seen the old gal, who walks the streets of London
      Dirt in her hair, and her clothes in rags?
      She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking
      Carrying her home, in two carrier bags
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
      And in the all-night cafe, at a quarter past eleven
      Some old man sitting there, all on his own
      Looking at the world, over the rim of his tea-cup
      Each day lasts an hour, then he wanders home alone
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
      And have you seen the old man, outside the seaman's mission?
      His memory's fading, with those medal ribbons that he wears
      And in our winter city, the rain cries little pity
      For one more forgotten hero, and a world that doesn't care
    \end{verse}
  \end{repeatedchords}
